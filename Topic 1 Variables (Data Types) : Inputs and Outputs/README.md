## Topic Chapter 1-1: Variables

**Variables** are used to store values in memory locations.
 
Variable Declaration can Identify a **Type**, **Name**, and **Value**.

Variable Names are called an **Identifier**.

You can **Define** Variables and **Initialize** them.

Definition Example:
```cpp
int first;
int second;
```

Initialize Example:
```cpp
int first = 1;
int second = 2;
```
   - Naming an Identifier has its own **rules**.
      - Must Start with a Letter or an underscore ' _ '.
      - Only contain letters, digits, and underscores.
      - Must not be reserved words like 'int', 'double, etc.
 
When Choosing an Identifier Name, consider how it describes its content.

   - Before use in programs, variables must be declared.
      - Variables 'can' be initialized at the declaration; Otherwise, the data within that Variable will contain garbage.

Multiple Variables can be Declared and Initialized under one Statement.

Multi-Variable Example:
```cpp
int x = 1, y = 2, z = 3;
```
